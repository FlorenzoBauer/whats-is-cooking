# Reflection:

Our biggest obstacle was using JS Promises to collect data from an API using .fetch(). If you're doing this for the first time in a proper app, it's a little more difficult than it seems. Getting this figured out was a big win. Getting all the tests figured out and keeping files organized kept us busy.
