# Overview
Welcome to What's Cooking, a website modeled after popular cooking sites such as allrecipes, nytcooking, etc.  The goal of this project was to work together as a team to build out a website that utilizes the fetch api, has a robust testing suite for data oriented functions and provides a clean user experience.

# Reflection:

Our biggest obstacle was using JS Promises to collect data from an api using .fetch(). If you're doing this for the first time in a proper app, it's a little more difficult than it seems. Getting this figured out was a big win. Getting all the tests figured out and keeping files organized kept us plenty busy as well.
